(SMILE CUT MACRO)

(X = X POSITION OF SMILE)
(Y = Y POSITION OF SMILE)
(Z = DEPTH OF SMILE)
(I = WIDTH OF SMILE)
(J = HEIGHT OF SMILE)


(MOVE VARIABLES)
#100 = #24  (X - X POSITION)
#101 = #25  (Y - Y POSITION)
#102 = #26  (Z - Z POSITION)
#103 = #9   (I - WIDTH)
#104 = #10  (J - HEIGHT)

(CENTER LINE X POS)
#105 = #100 + [#103/2]  (X + WIDTH/2)
(CENTER LINE Y POS)
#106 = #101 + [#104/2]  (Y = HEIGHT/2)

(LEFT EYE)
(HALF WAY BETWEEN LEFT EDGE AND CENTER)
(10% OF DISTANCE FROM TOP)
(TO 10% OF DISTANCE FROM CENTER)

(RIGHT EYE)
(SAME AS LEFT, BUT HALF BETWEEN RIGHT AND CENTER)
